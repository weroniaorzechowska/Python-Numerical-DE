# Numerical Methods for Differential Equations in Python

## Overview
This project focuses on the **implementation and application of numerical methods** to solve differential equations using Python. The project covers various numerical approaches for solving both **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** and **partial differential equations (PDEs)**, along with real-world applications such as **population dynamics**, **heat conduction**, and **tumor growth modeling**.

## Problem Statement
Differential equations are fundamental in modeling dynamic systems in physics, biology, and engineering. However, analytical solutions are often difficult or impossible to obtain for complex problems. This project aims to address this challenge by implementing numerical techniques to approximate solutions for different types of differential equations.
